# Python Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Tutorial.  Everyone interested in Python data structures should learn these:

- [Queues](1-queues.md)
- [Sets](2-sets.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
